# PokeTask!

Â¡Hello!

my name is Edward, i'm giving my first steps to fullstack developer. I've been learning HTML, CSS and Javascript the past years and made some projects using raw code, right now, i'm learning frontend with
ReactJS and as my first project i'm going to create a tasking app with pokemon catching system. 
You can guess how it goes.


## Ongoing...

It'll be as simple as catching Pokemon by tasking. i'm planning to create a catch treshold so people 
won't be able to just auto-complete tasks randomly to get themselves random pokemon. There's a lot of things
to go trough yet but i already finished the tasklist part and some of the visuals.

## Run Locally
